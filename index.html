    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>After 13 years of healthcare experience, I have made the move web development and design. I am proud to have worked as a Registered Nurse specializing in hospice, emergency, and case management.</p>
    
   <p> While my career in nursing did not provide experience in web development, I did have the opportunity to practice daily
    prioritization, interprofessional collaboration and communication, empathy, and complex problem solving while keeping
    the individual needs of my patients central. These skills are highly applicable to creating influential web content.</p>
    
    <p>The logic problems and creative aspects of web development and design attracted me to a new career in tech. I have made
    a curriculum to follow throughout the year of 2021 based on coding bootcamps syllabi. I am motivated to collaborate with
    small businesses and non-profits locally for coding and design projects and plan to contribute to open-source projects
    for experience.</p>
    
    <p>I am currently proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am learning React.</p>
    
   <p>This site serves as both a portfolio for development and design projects to add to throughout the year of 2021, and a
    chance for you to follow along in my journey to a career in tech. I would love to chat about my journey and/or
    collaborate on projects. Letâ€™s connect!</p>
