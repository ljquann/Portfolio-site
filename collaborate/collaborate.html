<h1> Now Accepting Projects!</h1>
<p> I am taking the year of 2021 to gain skills and experience before entering an active job search. </p>
<p>That being said, I am on the hunt for that experience! If you are a small business or non-profit who needs a simple but effective webpage, I
would love to be your pro-bono developer.  Letâ€™s chat about your needs, and whether or not I would be a good fit. </p>
<p>Email me at connect@lauraquann.com or find me on social media.</p>
